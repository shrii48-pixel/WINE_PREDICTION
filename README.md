# WINE_PREDICTION
This repository showcases a machine learning project focused on predicting the quality of red wines based on their chemical properties, using  Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression to classify or rate wine quality.
Key Features:
Predictive Modeling: Implemented various ML models to identify factors influencing wine quality.
Data Preprocessing: Handled data cleaning, feature scaling, and analysis of chemical attributes (e.g., acidity, sulfates, alcohol).
Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or R² to assess model performance.
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
How it Works:
Load the dataset (e.g., UCI Wine Quality Dataset).
Preprocess features like volatile acidity, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, etc..
Train selected ML models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier).
Evaluate and compare model performance.
